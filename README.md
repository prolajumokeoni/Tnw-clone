## TNW - Clone (Milestone 2)
> This is a clone of the [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/). We applied the mobile first approach to build a Responsive Web Design Project and it's built with HTML 5 and CSS3.
> We used media queries to make the page responsive. We designed media queries for tablet screens (768px) and Desktop screens (1024px)
> In this particular milestone we added three sections that are displayed below.
